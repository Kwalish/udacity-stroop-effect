Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree PART 2: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

This is my submission for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree's Statistic and the goal was to analyse from a statiscal point of view the stroop effect.

In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant’s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally­sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

Through this project, I tried to see if the congruent or incongurent display had an effect on participants' results.

I found out that the congruent test takes less time to undertake than the incongruent time (ie. It is easier to identify the color when it matches with the word than to identify the color when it does not match with the word.)
